# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We are helping Steve find the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
